## From unpopular to shity opinion

It's really common to find shity opinions disguised as "unpopular", that's why I brought you this extension. Let's unmask this opinions!

Here the instructions to do it:

1. Click on the Download Code icon (the green one up and right) and select the ZIP option
2. Once you downloaded it, unzip it in your wished location, can be Desktop, Documents, etc. but remember where you're storing it.
3.  Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable **Developer Mode**
5. Select **LOAD UNPACKED** option
6. Browse in your files and select the `from-unpopular-to-shity-extension` directory (the unzipped one)
7. The extension has been successfully installed!
8. Go to the disguised opinion URL, click on the poop-extension icon and unmask it.

You can make your own extension, I followed the Chrome's documentetion: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/
